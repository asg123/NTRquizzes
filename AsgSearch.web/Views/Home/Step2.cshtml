<h1>Step 2</h1>
<p>We want to keep historic information on what queries are performed by our users. So, every search performed by our application must be saved in a SQL server database. The first results obtained (only the first) should also be saved into the database.</p>
<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        You'll have to modify the HomeController class and use QueryService.SaveQuery method.
    </li>
    <li>
        By default, the database used is .\localhost\NTRsearchDB (maybe you have to uncomment something ;P). You can connect to it with the SQL Server Management Studio or the Database explorer in VS2010 with SQL Server Authentication user:sa password:ntrglobal
    </li>
    <li>
        Feel free to remove the existing database if tou run into problems while changing the schema since EF automatically re-creates it as needed. We don't care about migrations or database upgrades.
    </li>
</ul>
